\ref Recorded on 13 June 2009 in Esso by Natalia Aralova and Brigitte Pakendorf. NAT came to the house that BP and NA
were renting; we first had tea together where she chatted with us, then BP and NAT went into the living room, where the
recording took place; NA stayed in the kitchen, where she was not visible to NAT. A first attempt at a narrative was
interrupted by a mobile phone ringing, after which all phones were switched off and the narrative was started anew.
Other than an occasional truck going by on the street outside there are no extraneous sounds. NAT told four little
stories (each around 2 minutes in length) in Even; after narrating each of the stories, she renarrated it in Russian (with
more details, actually, than in the Even version). The Russian versions consitute a separate sound and video file. The
four narratives are archived as separate sessions. This is the last little narrative that was given when NAT was actually
already getting ready to go.
\qu Transcribed by BP with Rimma Maksimovna Egorovna, translated into Russian by RME, glossed by BP. Funding by the
Volkswagen Foundation (DoBeS grant). Speaker abbreviation = NAT
\ref Natalija Aleksandrovna Tylkanova was born in early June 1951, so she was 58 at the time of the recording. She has a
college-level education and works as a kindergarten teacher. Her father was Chuvash, and she is married to a Russian,
speaks Russian with her husband and children and felt that her Russian was more fluent than her Even.

\ft And they took him somewhere, to the army, and there he did what, he built that big (rail)road.
\ph
\gr
\nt The Baikal-Amur railroad was built to a large extent by soldiers on service in the army, and obviously they chose such
young men as knew how to work with a chainsaw. Since Valera had prior experience with chainsaws, they took him. The
BAM doesn't really play any further role in the narrative; probably NAT only mentions this detail because that explains
why Valera was in the army in a place where he could go hunting and where there were reindeer.

bujundej = idti na oxotu 1 raz --> basically I don't think that there is much difference between buju and bujun, while
bujuS does have a multiplicative meaning; it's VERY odd to have 2 ACC cases in one word - it sounds as if she says ọraM
all right, and then she starts to stammer; stutters around ọram... and -kakam, clearly first said "reindeer.acc" and then
thought that it was a small baby reindeer, and added the -kakam, therefore the double acc; the correct form would be
ọrkakam
