\ref Recorded on 13 March 2012 in Sebjan-Küöl by Brigitte Pakendorf. At the end of our field trip in 2010 we'd been told that
ZAS knows traditional Even songs, so recording some of these was one of the goals of the 2012 fieldtrip. However, when
ZAS came to the flat that BP was renting by prior arrangement in the evening, it turned out that the songs she was going to
sing were not really traditional, but had been written and composed in the 1950s or 1960s. Furthermore, the timing of the
recording was far from ideal, since ZAS wasn't feeling well, had a headache and a cold and a bit of a sore throat and she'd
obviously only come because she felt somewhat obliged since BP was about to leave the village. (An earlier recording hadn't
been possible because ZAS had only gotten back to the village from town a week before.) The recording took place in the
"kitchen" of the flat BP was renting, and it was fairly quiet, ZAS refused to be videotaped, so the recording was only done in
mono with a Marantz recorder. Before starting to sing ZAS had written down the words of the two songs she was planning to
sing; the songs are archived separately. The words of this song, "ujamkan" (mountain sheep), were written by Dmitrij
Vasilevich Krivoshapkin, a local Even writer and translator, the melody was composed by Marija Egorovna Gogoleva. The
mountain sheep is very important for Sebjan Even. It is explained in the fairy tale from Kirillina K.K (see
Kirillina_KK_dve_skazki: Sebjan Küöl - Narratives - Folklore). 
\qu Transcribed by BP, transcription checked and Russian translation by Ija Vasil'evna Krivoshapkina, glossing by BP. Funding by the
Volkswagen Foundation (DoBeS grant). Speaker abbreviation = ZAS.
\ref Zoja Afanas'evna Stepanova was 62 years old at time of recording, primary school teacher, social pedagogue (socpedagog)
and leader of folklore ensemble Merlenke, very much in favour of literary/standard Even language, feels that there are not
many differences between different dialects, mutual intelligibility, very much against all the mixing of Even and Sakha here
in Sebjan (“eto ne Lamunxinskij govor”), very interested in Even folklore and language. Sister of Afanasij Afanas'evič
Stepanov

\gr EAK said that goːndekun = imenno sejčas skazhu, while goːndeku = skazhu; here: goːndekun = rasskazhu, not just skazhu,
so she saw a difference in meaning
\nt
\gr checked with IVK who said that there is absolutely no difference between goːndeku and goːndekuN - which sort of fits the
corpus data, where I find both forms in probably roughly the same proportions; IVK also said that there is a third variant
goːndek; and it also fits with what I know about Even grammar...

\ph
\gr EAK: at first she said it should be helkunin, but then said, no, this is about now, so helkenun is correct, but then she said that
helkenun = davno prošedšee vremja; there is helken- and there is helkun- , there are place names helkuniː; one can say
helkenedden
\nt
\gr IVK: helkenun - this should be helkunnen, from helkun-, but she wasn't really sure - but that is how I decided to gloss it

meaning of "srazu" derives from the combination of -DEŋ + restrictive + copula bi-; and one could say "hoteldeŋenteken
biwren" with the same meaning
