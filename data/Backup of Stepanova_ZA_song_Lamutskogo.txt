\ref Recorded on 13 March 2012 in Sebjan-Küöl by Brigitte Pakendorf. At the end of our field trip in 2010 we'd been told
that ZAS knows traditional Even songs, so recording some of these was one of the goals of the 2012 fieldtrip. However,
when ZAS came to the flat that BP was renting by prior arrangement in the evening, it turned out that the songs she was
going to sing were not really traditional, but had been written and composed in the 1950s or 1960s. Furthermore, the
timing of the recording was far from ideal, since ZAS wasn't feeling well, had a headache and a cold and a bit of a sore
throat and she'd obviously only come because she felt somewhat obliged since BP was about to leave the village. (An
earlier recording hadn't been possible because ZAS had only gotten back to the village from town a week before.) The
recording took place in the "kitchen" of the flat BP was renting, and it was fairly quiet, ZAS refused to be videotaped, so
the recording was only done in mono with a Marantz recorder. Before starting to sing ZAS had written down the words
of the two songs she was planning to sing; the songs are archived separately. The words of the first song, "ujamkan"
(mountain sheep), were written by Dmitrij Vasilevich Krivoshapkin, a local Even writer and translator, the melody was
composed by Marija Egorovna Gogoleva. The mountain sheep is very important for Sebjan Even. It is explained in the
fairy tale from Kirillina K.K (see Kirillina_KK_dve_skazki: Sebjan Küöl - Narratives - Folklore).
\qu Transcribed by BP, transcription checked and Russian translation by Ija Vasil'evna Krivoshapkina, glossing by BP. Funding by the
Volkswagen Foundation (DoBeS grant). Speaker abbreviation = ZAS.
\ref Zoja Afanas'evna Stepanova was 62 years old at time of recording, primary school teacher, social pedagogue
(socpedagog) and leader of folklore ensemble Merlenke, very much in favour of literary/standard Even language, feels
that there are not many differences between different dialects, mutual intelligibility, very much against all the mixing of
Even and Sakha here in Sebjan (“eto ne Lamunxinskij govor”), very interested in Even folklore and language. Sister of
Afanasij Afanas'evič Stepanov

\gr IVK - didn't really know the verb čụːnịddan, and didn't know whether the root was čụːnị or čụːnịd, but said it meant
"žurčit, tečet"; duledden = progrevaetsja, there is only duhli "warm", not dulehe or duleje; she didn't accept the form
dulelukeli "postavj progrevatj" (EAK had said that she says this to tell her son to put the food to heat up on the stove; IVK
said that duhli = teplyj, warm, and for food you need "hot", so she said there is hokelukeli > hoktej > hokeldej >
hokelukendej

\nt
\gr with IVK: etebdej is the medio-passive of ettej; etebdej means "bytj zavoevannym", while ettej means "to overcome"
"zavoevatj", is used mainly about knives, when a knife is able to cut something, "peresilivaet", ettej = osilitj, etepten =
bytj osilennym
\nt this was written after Jurij Gagarin flew to space (the moon?)

\gr EAK had said tegele meant "dlja nashej zhizni" , derived from teget-, some shortened form, but I think IVK's translation
makes more sense and fits the glossing better

\gr EAK said that the ornemi here has a 1sg meaning, and it is shortened to fit the metre
\gr the form orenemi doesn't really make sense here, because it means "go and be happy", what would make sense is oremi
"being happy", the plain conditional converb of oren-
