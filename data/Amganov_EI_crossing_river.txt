\ref Recorded on 14 June 2009 in Esso by Natalia Aralova and Brigitte Pakendorf. BP and NA went to visit the Amganovs,
where we first drank tea, looked at their photo album and asked some questions; only after an hour did we get out the
recording equipment. NA was in charge of the video, while BP monitored the Marantz recorder. Only EIA and EPA were
present (in addition to BP and NA); however, somewhere in the middle of the recording a daughter or two plus grandkids
slipped in and out - but they did not join in the storytelling. Other than that there were hardly any surrounding noises.
EIA was in a storytelling mood and kept remembering humourous little anecdotes, which he recounted with a lot of
accompanying gestures. In between he gave Russian summaries/retold it all in Russian - but the video files were cut in
such a way as to exclude that (except where he switched to Russian in the middle of an Even narrative). The individual
anecdotes (11 in total, varying in length from 1 minute to 12 minutes) were analysed individually, as individual
ELAN/Toolbox files. This is the last little anecdote of the day.
\qu Transcribed by BP with Rimma Maksimovna Egorova, who also provided the Russian translation; glossed by BP. Funding by the
Volkswagen Foundation (DoBeS grant). Speaker abbreviation = EIA, EPA
\ref Efim Innokent'evich Amganov was born in 1952, i.e. he was 56-57 at the time of the recording. He had a college-level
education and worked as a driver before going on pension. He passed away in 2012.
\ref Elena Petrovna Amganova was born in 1952, i.e. she was 56-57 at the time of the recording. She had 8 years of schooling
and had worked as a milker and then a cleaner.

swallowed the Accusative ending, like he's wont to do
