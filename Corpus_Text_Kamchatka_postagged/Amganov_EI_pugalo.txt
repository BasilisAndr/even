\ref Recorded on 14 June 2009 in Esso by Natalia Aralova and Brigitte Pakendorf. BP and NA went to visit the Amganovs,
where we first drank tea, looked at their photo album and asked some questions; only after an hour did we get out the
recording equipment. NA was in charge of the video, while BP monitored the Marantz recorder. Only EIA and EPA
were present (in addition to BP and NA); however, somewhere in the middle of the recording a daughter or two plus
grandkids slipped in and out - but they did not join in the storytelling. Other than that there were hardly any
surrounding noises. EIA was in a storytelling mood and kept remembering humourous little anecdotes, which he
recounted with a lot of accompanying gestures. In between he gave Russian summaries/retold it all in Russian - but the
video files were cut in such a way as to exclude that (except where he switched to Russian in the middle of an Even
narrative). The individual anecdotes (11 in total, varying in length from 1 minute to 12 minutes) were analysed
individually, as individual ELAN/Toolbox files. This narrative is half in Even (only about 6 annotations), half in Russian;
it's about how some children were frightened by some milkers; it's the fourth anecdote of the session. It tells the same
episode as that told by Rimma Maksimovna Egorova in the second half of the "Utakan" session.
\qu Transcribed by BP with Rimma Maksimovna Egorova, who also provided the Russian translation; glossed by BP. Funding by the
Volkswagen Foundation (DoBeS grant). Speaker abbreviation = EIA, EPA
\ref Efim Innokent'evich Amganov was born in 1952, i.e. he was 56-57 at the time of the recording. He had a college-level
education and worked as a driver before going on pension. He passed away in 2012.
\ref Elena Petrovna Amganova was born in 1952, i.e. she was 56-57 at the time of the recording. She had 8 years of schooling
and had worked as a milker and then a cleaner.

\nt Appaljan was a mask and costume which was used only to frighten children away from places where they weren't
supposed to go, or in order to frighten them back home in the evening, if they were running about too late; it consisted
of the fur from the head of a reindeer, including the nose, which was put on the wearer's head, and also fur leggings and
jacket worn with the fur outside, to give it a shaggy appearance
