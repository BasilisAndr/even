\ref Recorded on 14 June 2009 in Esso by Natalia Aralova and Brigitte Pakendorf. BP and NA went to visit the Amganovs, where we first drank tea,
looked at their photo album and asked some questions; only after an hour did we get out the recording equipment. NA was in charge of the
video, while BP monitored the Marantz recorder. Only EIA and EPA were present (in addition to BP and NA); however, somewhere in the
middle of the recording a daughter or two plus grandkids slipped in and out - but they did not join in the storytelling. Other than that there were
hardly any surrounding noises. EIA was in a storytelling mood and kept remembering humourous little anecdotes, which he recounted with a
lot of accompanying gestures. In between he gave Russian summaries/retold it all in Russian - but the video files were cut in such a way as to
exclude that (except where he switched to Russian in the middle of an Even narrative). The individual anecdotes (11 in total, varying in length
from 1 minute to 12 minutes) were analysed individually, as individual ELAN/Toolbox files. This is the 6th little anecdote.
\qu Transcribed by BP with Rimma Maksimovna Egorova, who also provided the Russian translation; glossed by BP. Funding by the Volkswagen Foundation
(DoBeS grant). Speaker abbreviation = EIA, EPA
\ref Efim Innokent'evich Amganov was born in 1952, i.e. he was 56-57 at the time of the recording. He had a college-level education and worked as a
driver before going on pension. He passed away in 2012.
\ref Elena Petrovna Amganova was born in 1952, i.e. she was 56-57 at the time of the recording. She had 8 years of schooling and had worked as a
milker and then a cleaner.

\ft We once watched a film a lot, Chapaev.
\ph
\gr The whole sentence is in Russian, with the exception of omneken 'once' which is in Even.
\nt Chapaev was a hero of the Civil War who fought for the Bolsheviks; the movie made about him (from the 40's or 50's?) is part of general Soviet
culture (and the source of many Russian jokes)
