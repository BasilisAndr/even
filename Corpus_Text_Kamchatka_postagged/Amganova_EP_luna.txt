\ref Recorded 27 June 2009 in Esso by Natalia Aralova and Brigitte Pakendorf. NA and BP went to the house of the
Amganovs on purpose to ask EPA to narrate a recording; this was already the 5th or 6th visit of NA (who had been
recording the phonological word list with EPA's husband Efim) at the Amganov's house - so the whole set-up with
video-camera and taking down the loudly ticking clock etc were quite familiar; on the other hand, EPA was clearly
getting somewhat fed up with linguists and their incessant wishes to record things.  We talked a bit beforehand in Russian
about what she could tell, and she told several little anecdotes, some only a few sentences long. We (BP, NA and EPA)
were the only people in the house, and the recording was done in their kitchen, where we took down the ticking clock
and switched off the radio, so that it was quiet.
\qu Transcribed by BP, transcription checked with Elena Nikolaevna Cherkanova, Russian translation by Elena Nikolaevna Cherkanova,
glossing by BP. Funding by the Volkswagen Foundation (DoBeS grant). Speaker abbreviation = EPA.
\ref Elena Petrovna Amganova was born in 1952, i.e. she was 56-57 at the time of the recording. She had 8 years of
schooling and had worked as a milker and then a cleaner.

\nt From what EPA had said prior to the recording, it was Ira who called her brother outside to show him the sun, but both
Lena Cherkanova and RME understood this as being Zhenja, the older brother, calling his little sister outside - so 'tarak'
appears to refer to the last-mentioned person, and that is Zhenja in this case
