\ge med
\nt This is the medio-passive; it
derives O-oriented resultatives (=
verbs with stative reference
regularly derived from action
verbs) from transitives, or verbs
with a spontaneous/potential
meaning. Some verbs make the
distinction between the transitive
and intransitive form by having a
final -L and -R, respectively, e.g.
tekel 'tear.trns' and teker 'tear.intr',
kibal 'break.trns' and kibar
'break.intr'.

\dt 13/Jun/2009
\nt The variant in -ch occurs with
default vowel + consonant stems;
the variant in -n' occurs with
'primary n' stems; the variant in -dji
occurs with plural, possessive, and
possessive reflexive. Instrumental
denotes an instrument or means of
transportation; in some dialects it
denotes material (competing with
Ablative in this function). Verbs of
emotion assign Instrumental to
source of emotion (says
Malchukov; but is this only
negative emotion, or also positive
emotion?) When added to
ADJECTIVES --> ADVERBS

more often, it has a resultative
meaning; but it can also have an
imperfective meaning, e.g. bo:
'give', bo:t 'be giving, give several
times, distribute'. When attached
to NEGATIVE AUX e- this
morpheme denotes the PST
indicative.

with only a meaning of process
(Ija Krivoshapkina's memories), so
I had entered a separate nr
morpheme; but in Kamchatka I
have -ek or -k as 'place for vrbing',

RDA (shatun007) has oskuola

Rishes&Cincius give the suffix
-djE:n as the iterative aspect, which
is what Novikova (?) calls the
durative, and which actually
appears to have some diminutive,
emotional meaning. I wonder if
-dne could be the "durative" suffix
metathesized? It only occurs with a
few verbs, e.g. tiketnedej 'fall
several times', nihednedej
'spotykat'sja', djalkatnadaj
'zaxlebyvatsja', nibgadnadaj
'choke?' zadyshat'sja,

(quite rarely) on nouns, and as a
more emphatic, intensifying
(usilitelnyj) suffix, especially
frequent in adverbs (echiken,
bekecchen - though here the form
is chen, but I would argue that's
assimilation) and in converbs,
imarikandji - this sometimes with

Immediate precedence converb,

from the data in the corpus and the

(emcheni_127) this is just a clearly
simultaneous action, there is no
element of duration, and no
element of immediate precedence,
but this action happening at the

durative converb is not a good

Instrumental marked version was
better; he collective numerals on

the nonfuture marker is zero
followed by the person suffix; the
3PL is haa-r. It is not clear whether
this -r is to be analyzed as the
person agreement suffix (with zero
nonfuture suffix) or as the short
form of the nonfuture suffix with
zero person agreement suffix. This
latter variant is followed by the
other conjugations: bi-se-nri

stems. Accusative primarily marks
direct object; but with noun with
temporal reference it can denote a

OBJECTS can also be marked by
the Nominative with reflexive
possessive suffixes or by the
Designative.

noun is adversely affected, rather
